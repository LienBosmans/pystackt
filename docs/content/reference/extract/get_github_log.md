# ‚õèÔ∏èüêô `get_github_log`: Extracting object-centric event logs from GitHub

## üìù Example
```python
from pystackt import *

get_github_log(
    GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN="insert_your_github_access_token_here",
    repo_owner="LienBosmans",
    repo_name="stack-t",
    max_issues=None,
    save_after_num_issues=1000,
    quack_db="./stackt.duckdb",
    schema="main"
)
```

| Parameter              | Type     | Description   |
|------------------------|----------|---------------|
| `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`  | `str`    | Personal GitHub personal access token for API authentication. |
| `repo_owner`           | `str`    | Owner of the GitHub repository from which to extract issue activity data. |
| `repo_name`            | `str`    | Name of the repository from which to extract issue activity data. |
| `max_issues`           | `int`    | Limits the number of issues to extract. If `None`, data for all closed issues will be collected. |
| `save_after_num_issues`| `int`    | Enables intermediate saving after processing this many issues. Prevents data loss from interruptions. Defaults to 5000. |
| `quack_db`             | `str`    | Path to the DuckDB file where data will be stored using the Stack‚Äôt relational schema. A new file is created if it doesn't exist yet. |
| `schema`               | `str`    | Name of the schema in the DuckDB database file where data will be written. If schema already exists, it will be cleared first. |


### Generating a GitHub Access Token (`GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`)
To generate a GitHub access token, go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens), click **"Generate new token (classic)"**, and proceed without selecting any scopes (leave all checkboxes unchecked). Copy the token and store it securely, as it won‚Äôt be shown again.

### GithHub Repository (`repo_owner`/`repo_name`)
These values are used to identify the GitHub repository from which the activity data will be extracted. You don't need to own or fork the repository. Permission to view the repository is sufficient, which is always the case for public repositories. If you want to extract data from a private repository, you'll need to create a different access token with a scope that includes read-only access to that repo.

### Maximum number of issues to return (`max_issues`)
Because of API rate limits, fetching all activity data from a repo can take a long time. This parameter controls the number of issues for which data will be collected. Setting it to a positive integer `n` will return data from the `n` most recent issues with status "closed". Setting it to `None` will return the activity data for all closed issues.

### Intermediate save functionality (`save_after_num_issues`)
To mitigate the risk of forced system restarts and GitHub API outages, intermediate save functionality was added. Setting it to a reasonable number such as 500 or 1000 does not impact total extraction times and greatly decreases potential disappointment. The default value is 5000.

### Output database file (`quack_db`) and schema (`schema`)
The extracted data will be stored in a DuckDB database using the Stack't relational schema. The tables will be stored in the given `schema`; the default schema is main. If the file does not exist yet, a new file will be created. Existing tables in `schema` will be overwritten.

To explore the data, you'll need a database manager. You can follow this [DuckDB guide](https://duckdb.org/docs/guides/sql_editors/dbeaver.html) to download and install **DBeaver** for easy access.  

## üìú Data Usage Policies
Please ensure that you extract and use the data in **compliance with GitHub policies**, including [Information Usage Restrictions](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies#7-information-usage-restrictions) and [API Terms](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#h-api-terms).
