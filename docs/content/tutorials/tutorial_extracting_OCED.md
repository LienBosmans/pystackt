# Tutorial: Extracting your first object-centric event log from a GitHub repository

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll extract an **object-centric event log** from a real GitHub repository. You donâ€™t need to know much about process mining or GitHub yet â€” weâ€™ll walk through it step by step.  

By the end, you will:
- Install and use **PyStackâ€™t**, a Python library for extracting object-centric event data.
- Create a GitHub personal access token.
- Extract event data from a repository.
- Export the data into the OCEL 2.0 format.
- Load the resulting log into Ocelot, a tool for analyzing object-centric logs.

Letâ€™s get started!

# Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

-   **Python 3.12 or higher** installed on your computer.  
    You can check this by running `python --version` in your terminal.  
    If you donâ€™t have it yet, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  

-   A **GitHub account**.  
    If you donâ€™t already have one, you can create it for free at [github.com](https://github.com/).  
    Weâ€™ll need it to generate an access token later.  

With these in place, youâ€™re ready to proceed.

# Install PyStack't

First, we need to install the library weâ€™ll be using: **PyStackâ€™t**.  
Open a terminal (or command prompt) and run:

```sh
pip install pystackt
```

This will download and install the package from PyPI.
If you see errors about pip not being found, try running `python -m pip install pystackt` instead.

Once installed, you can test it worked by running:

```sh
python -c "import pystackt; print('PyStackt is installed!')"
```

If you see the confirmation message, youâ€™re ready to move on.

# Generate GitHub access token

PyStackâ€™t needs permission to read from GitHub repositories. For this, we use a personal access token.
1.  Log in to your [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
1.  Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
1.  Click "Generate new token (classic)".
1.  Donâ€™t select any scopes (leave all checkboxes unchecked).
1.  Generate the token and copy it. GitHub will only show it once, so store it somewhere safe. Weâ€™ll use this token in the next step.
    -   If you lose your token, you can always generate a new one.
    -   If you accidently share your token, for example by comitting it to Git, it's good practice to delete it and generate a new token.

# Extract object-centric event data from GitHub repository

Now letâ€™s extract event data from a real repository.

Open a Python file (for example `extract_log.py`) or a Jupyter Notebook, and paste in the following code:

```python
from pystackt import *

get_github_log(
    GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN="insert_your_github_access_token_here",
    repo_owner="LienBosmans",
    repo_name="stack-t",
    max_issues=None, # None returns all issues, can also be set to an integer to extract a limited data set
    quack_db="./stackt.duckdb",
    schema="main"
)
```

ðŸ‘‰ Replace `insert_your_github_access_token_here` with the token you generated earlier.

When you run this code, PyStackâ€™t will connect to GitHub, fetch issue and pull request data from the [stackt-t repository](https://github.com/LienBosmans/stack-t), and store it locally in a DuckDB database file called `stackt.duckdb`.

# Export to OCEL 2.0

Now that the raw data is stored, letâ€™s export it into the OCEL 2.0 format. This is a common format for object-centric event logs.

Add the following code to your script or notebook:

```python
export_to_ocel2(
    quack_db="./stackt.duckdb",
    schema_in="main",
    schema_out="ocel2",
    sqlite_db="./ocel2_stackt.sqlite"
)
```

This will create a new SQLite database file called `ocel2_stackt.sqlite` that contains the event log in OCEL 2.0 format.
You now have a portable log that can be used in other analysis tools.

# Load OCEL 2.0 log in Ocelot

Finally, letâ€™s open the log in the analysis tool Ocelot.
1.  Go to [https://ocelot.pm/](https://ocelot.pm/)
1.  Drag and drop `ocel2_stackt.sqlite` in the Event Log Import window.
1.  You should now see the object-centric event log extracted from the GitHub repository! ðŸŽ‰
